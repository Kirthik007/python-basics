Python Conditions and If statements
Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:

Equals: a == b
Not Equals: a != b
Less than: a < b
Less than or equal to: a <= b
Greater than: a > b
Greater than or equal to: a >= b
in
also
and or can be used
These conditions can be used in several ways, most commonly in "if statements" and loops.

An "if statement" is written by using the if keyword.
