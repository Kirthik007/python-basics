''' bubble sort Bubble Sort algorithm, which sorts an array by repeatedly comparing 
 adjacent elements and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. The algorithm iterates
 through the array multiple times, with each pass pushing the largest unsorted element to its 
 correct position at the end.  this has O(nlogn)'''

""" Quick sort  QuickSort is a divide and conquer algorithm. 
It picks an element as a pivot and partitions the given array 
around the picked pivot. In simple terms:

- **Best and Average Case** for QuickSort: **O(n log n)**
- **Worst Case** for QuickSort: **O(nÂ²)**

This means that QuickSort is usually very efficient (best and average cases),
 but it can become slower (worst case) if the pivot selection is poor.
